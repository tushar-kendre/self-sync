# ✅ SelfSync MVP Roadmap

---

## 🧱 **Phase 1 – Core Behavior Tracking (MVP Core)**

**Goal:** Build the essential offline app that tracks your habits, urges, mood, and journals in a simple, usable UI.

### 🔨 Features to Build:

- [ ] Local database (SQLite) setup with data encryption
- [ ] Home screen: daily check-in + streak display
- [ ] Log screen with:
  - Wake/Sleep time + sleep quality rating
  - Mood picker (1–5) + energy level
  - Quick journal entry with encryption
  - Addiction logs (porn, reels, binge, weed, nicotine)
  - Urge logging (resisted/given) with intensity scale (1-10)
  - Study duration entry + focus rating
  - Healthy habit checkbox list (e.g., read, meditate)
  - Trigger identification + coping strategy logging

- [ ] Streak tracker (for each harmful behavior)
- [ ] Weekly dashboard with:
  - Mood trend line
  - Clean streak bar
  - Study minutes bar
  - Habit heatmap

- [ ] Local-only storage (SQLite) with automatic backups
- [ ] Settings page: PIN lock, data export, crisis resources
- [ ] Crisis support features: emergency contacts, panic button
- [ ] Real-time coping strategies when logging urges

### 🧠 Value:

- Gives you full visibility and ownership of your days
- Forms the foundation of your habit-breaking and reflection cycle
- Launches the app quickly and privately

---

## ⚙️ **Phase 2 – AI & Insight Layer (MVP+)**

**Goal:** Add optional AI layer to give weekly summaries and emotional insights.

### 🔨 Features to Build:

- [ ] AI engine abstraction layer (start with GPT-3.5/GPT-4 via OpenAI)
- [ ] Local sentiment analysis using lightweight models (privacy-first)
- [ ] Weekly summary generator:
  - Behavior correlation: "Mood drops after binge nights"
  - Pattern extraction: "Study is more frequent after early wake-up"
  - Trigger pattern recognition (time, location, emotional state)

- [ ] Journal tone analysis (sentiment + key topics)
- [ ] Motivational nudge generator
- [ ] Personalized intervention suggestions based on successful past strategies
- [ ] Toggle in settings: **Enable AI insights (cloud-based)**

### 🧠 Value:

- Gives you **non-obvious insights** into emotional triggers and positive habits
- Adds **depth and meaning** to your data
- Makes weekly review feel like personalized coaching

---

## 🕹️ **Phase 3 – Gamification & Smart Nudges (MVP++)**

**Goal:** Boost engagement and long-term habit formation with motivational features.

### 🔨 Features to Build:

- [ ] “Win of the Day” visual card (e.g., “You resisted an urge + studied!”)
- [ ] Streak celebration animations (3, 7, 14, 30 days)
- [ ] Smart reminders:
  - Based on usage pattern ("No log today — how are you feeling?")
  - Screen-time detection (“Over 30 min on reels today — check-in?”)

- [ ] Customizable habit list + streaks for positive habits
- [ ] "Best Day of the Week" AI card

### 🧠 Value:

- Makes progress feel **visible, motivating, and rewarding**
- Provides timely nudges to **interrupt harmful behavior**
- Encourages long-term habit change without guilt

# 🚀 Deployment Plan

| Phase       | Timeline | Deliverables                                      |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1** | Week 1–3 | Core tracking UI, SQLite, streaks, journaling     |
| **Phase 2** | Week 4–5 | AI weekly summary, journal tone NLP, insights     |
| **Phase 3** | Week 6–7 | Gamification UI, smart nudges, behavior reminders |

---

## 🧪 Optional Phase 0.5 – Foundation & Safety

Before Phase 1, consider these critical foundations:

- [ ] **User research** with target audience (mental health users)
- [ ] **Mental health professional consultation** for feature validation
- [ ] **Accessibility audit** of UI designs (screen readers, color contrast)
- [ ] **Security architecture review** for data protection
- [ ] **Crisis intervention protocol** design
- [ ] **Legal compliance review** (privacy laws, mental health regulations)

---

## 🧪 Optional Phase 0 – Prototype & UI Testing

If you're starting from scratch:

- Build screens in React Native without backend
- Use in-memory mock data for form flow + layout polish
- Gather initial feedback from yourself to iterate quickly

## 🧰 Tools & Tech Stack

| Area           | Tool                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Framework      | React Native (Expo or CLI)                             |
| Storage        | `react-native-sqlite-storage` or WatermelonDB          |
| State Mgmt     | Zustand or React Query (better than Context)           |
| Notifications  | `react-native-push-notification`                       |
| AI Integration | OpenAI SDK (for GPT-4o) via secure API call            |
| Charts         | `react-native-svg-charts` or `Victory Native`          |
| Security       | `expo-local-authentication` or `react-native-keychain` |
| Voice Input    | `react-native-voice` for accessibility                 |
| Encryption     | `react-native-crypto-js` for data protection           |

## 🏗️ Enhanced Architecture Considerations

### **State Management Structure:**

```typescript
// Zustand store example
interface AppStore {
  dailyLogs: DailyLog[];
  behaviorLogs: BehaviorLog[];
  currentStreaks: Record<string, number>;
  aiInsights: Insight[];
  settings: UserSettings;

  // Actions
  addDailyLog: (log: DailyLog) => void;
  addBehaviorLog: (log: BehaviorLog) => void;
  calculateStreaks: () => void;
  toggleAIFeatures: (enabled: boolean) => void;
}
```

### **Database Schema with Indexes:**

```sql
-- Performance optimizations
CREATE INDEX idx_daily_logs_date ON daily_logs(date);
CREATE INDEX idx_behavior_logs_type_date ON behavior_logs(type, date);
CREATE INDEX idx_urge_intensity ON behavior_logs(urge_intensity, was_resisted);
```

### **Accessibility Features:**

- Voice input for journaling during difficult moments
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- One-handed operation design
- Large text support

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation Strategy

### **Phase 1 Testing:**

- [ ] **Unit tests** for core data functions
- [ ] **Integration tests** for database operations
- [ ] **Accessibility testing** with screen readers
- [ ] **Performance testing** with large datasets
- [ ] **Security testing** for encryption features

### **User Validation:**

- [ ] **Self-testing** for 2 weeks before expanding
- [ ] **Mental health professional review** of crisis features
- [ ] **Accessibility audit** with users who have disabilities

Would you like me to now:

- Create a GitHub README + folder skeleton for Phase 1?
- Provide example schema code + seed database setup?

Let me know how hands-on you want to go from here.
